# HireSync Development Environment Automation

## Summary of Improvements

We've significantly improved the development environment automation for HireSync with the following changes:

### 1. Unified Command Interface

- Created a single `hiresync` script that provides a unified interface for all development tasks
- Removed separate scripts (`run-local`, `check-env`, `stop-local`) and consolidated their functionality
- Added new commands for improved automation:
  - `start`, `stop`, and `restart` commands for environment control
  - `status` command to check the current state of services
  - `logs` command to view PostgreSQL logs
  - `psql` command to access the PostgreSQL interactive terminal
  - `clean` command to reset the environment completely
  - `setup` command for initial environment initialization

### 2. Simplified Workflow

- Reduced the number of steps needed to start development
- Automated environment verification before starting services
- Improved error handling and user-friendly messages
- Added color-coded output for better readability

### 3. Better Documentation

- Updated README.md with new command information
- Created a comprehensive SETUP.md guide
- Added detailed instructions for Windows users with Git Bash
- Included usage examples and common workflows

### 4. Improved Cross-Platform Compatibility

- Standardized on Bash for cross-platform compatibility
- Added clear instructions for Windows users
- Streamlined environment setup process

## Getting Started

To begin using the improved automation:

1. Clone the repository
2. Make the script executable (on Unix/macOS/Git Bash): `chmod +x hiresync`
3. Run initial setup: `./hiresync setup`
4. Start the development environment: `./hiresync start`

## Using the Unified Script

```bash
./hiresync <command>
```

For a complete list of commands, run:

```bash
./hiresync help
```

## Windows Users

Windows users should run the script using Git Bash:

```bash
# In Git Bash
./hiresync <command>
```

## Further Improvements

Potential future improvements:

1. Add support for different profiles (development, testing, production)
2. Implement data backup and restore functionality
3. Add health monitoring for the application
4. Automate more common development tasks
5. Support for multi-service configuration
